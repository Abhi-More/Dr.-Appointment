# Dr. Appointment

# Doctor Appointment System

## Description

The Doctor Appointment System is a web application developed using Angular. This system allows an admin to manage doctor appointments, including functionalities for login, viewing a list of appointments, adding, editing, and deleting appointments. The system ensures that all fields are validated, and appropriate error messages are displayed when validation fails. Additionally, it checks for conflicts when a doctor is booked on a particular date and time.

## Features

- **Admin Login**: Secure login for admin.
- **Appointment Management**: View, add, edit, and delete appointments.
- **Validations**: All fields are mandatory with appropriate validations.
- **Conflict Detection**: Prevents booking a doctor on the same date and time.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses Bootstrap for a responsive and clean UI.
- **Notifications**: Uses ngx-toastr for displaying success and error messages.
